I’m sure you can tell me whether it is.”\\n\\n“Well, I can’t really say how much it would sell for. This is my first time handling a meteor too. However, I don’t think even an insignia of this quality can match up to it― In short, I think you have a lot to gain by making this trade.”\\n\\n“I see, I see.

But I’m not quite done overcharging just yet, you know?”\\n\\n“… It’s not exactly praiseworthy for you yourself to announce that. But it’s pointless to try haggling any further. As I said, I’m completely broke.”\\n\\n“I’m not that cruel either. And even Rom said that this thing would be worth more than this insignia, so I recognize that much. ― But it’d be a lie to say you’re out of cards to play.”\\n\\nFelt stood up and looked down at Subaru who was still sat in his chair.\\n\\nHer red eyes were overflowing with sadism, Subaru broke out in a cold sweat as her gaze seemed to see right through him.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'arc-1-chapter-9.txt'}, page_content='Felt stood up and looked down at Subaru who was still sat in his chair.\\n\\nHer red eyes were overflowing with sadism, Subaru broke out in a cold sweat as her gaze seemed to see right through him.\\n\\nAs far as this negotiation was concerned, he’d already played what should have been his trump card, his cell phone.\\n\\nHowever, Subaru still had a number of items on him that didn’t exist in this world.\\n\\nThe coins and various membership cards in his wallet could probably be exchanged for some amount of money. If it came down to it, it wouldn’t be unthinkable to even trade away his jersey and sneakers, technical assistance in a sense.\\n\\nThe phone was his most valuable asset, but he did have some other items he hadn’t yet shown them.\\n\\nBut these could be used to help support his life later on, so he really didn’t want to spend them here if possible.\\n\\n―But if the cell phone wasn’t enough, he would have to use them.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'arc-1-chapter-9.txt'}, page_content='But these could be used to help support his life later on, so he really didn’t want to spend them here if possible.\\n\\n―But if the cell phone wasn’t enough, he would have to use them.\\n\\n“Relax, I told you, didn’t I?

Ah, it’s simple. You’re not the only one I’m negotiating with.”\\n\\nSubaru looked doubtful, and as if to respond to that doubt, Felt raised her finger,\\n\\n“To begin with, I only pilfered this insignia because I was asked to.

I’m not sure how much ten gold coins are worth, but…”\\n\\nHe glanced at Rom, and Rom nodded as if he’d guessed what Subaru was thinking.\\n\\n“I might be able to get four or five gold coins for it.

That meteor you’ve got wouldn’t sell for any less than twenty holy gold coins. Depending on the situation, there might even be enthusiasts willing to pay a lot more. There’s no comparison.”\\n\\nHe didn’t really understand how things were valued in this world, but apparently there was something even higher than gold coins, and his phone was worth twenty of those which surprised him.\\n\\nHis phone with less than ten contacts in it was starting to look like some sacred treasure to him.\\n\\nAnd since he didn’t use it very much, it looked good too.
