Contrary to everyone’s expectations, Anastasia seemed to be striking a preemptive blow. The atmosphere in the Water Plumage Pavilion tensed.

Emilia: [——Thanks for welcoming us in person, it makes us feel at ease.]

Coming out to meet Emilia had certainly been calculated. While Subaru was lost in thought, a slightly confused Emilia voiced a reply, grabbing his attention.

Anastasia cast a frown at Subaru, probably pondering the origins of Garfiel, who was standing next to him, and Beatrice, who was clinging to his sleeve. Subaru, having spent many days frolicking with them in the mansion, was calmed down by their presence.

Anastasia: [——The same face as always.]

Her gaze left Subaru for Emilia as she murmured to herself, her light green eyes bearing a hint of ridicule. Her relationship with Emilia had changed little in the year past, a small conflict arising between them was not unexpected.

Subaru: [Well, she’s just as cute as… No, she’s even cuter than before.]

Emilia: [Subaru, don’t kid around with such a serious expression.]

Hearing her response, Subaru rubbed his nose with an air of awkwardness, noting that Beatrice was paying close attention to the proceedings. The corners of Anastasia’s mouth lifted in a faint smile.

Anastasia: [Natsuki-kun, I heard that after the subjugation of the White Whale stuff went a bit awry. Are Roswaal’s border territories doin’ well?]

Subaru: [Sorry you had to catch such unpleasant news. Thanks to your troops, we survived the aftermath. As companions, we’ll mutually support each other, right?]

Anastasia: [Is that so? I’m glad ya think the same way. The two of us were glad ya could come. It’s been a while since you’ve seen Julius, yes?]

Anastasia clapped her hands together, taking an opportunity to tease Subaru, who immediately caught on and frowned. Emilia and Anastasia laughed simultaneously, as Subaru grew uncomfortable, thinking that neither of them understood his complex relationship with Julius. He had tried to explain it over and over to Emilia, but each attempt inevitably ended in failure.

Garfiel: [Ah… That’s a bit strange. I’m guessin’ the woman’s one of Emilia-sama’s enemies?]

The previously silent Garfiel voiced a question, making no attempt to conceal his hostility. Subaru scratched his head in helpless embarrassment, and Anastasia’s round eyes grew rounder.

Emilia: [Garfiel, you’re not wrong, but you’re putting it in a pretty extreme way. After all, weren’t we invited here?]

Garfiel: [Yeah but still, won’tcha hafta stab each other in the back one day? That’s gonna sting after actin’ all buddy-buddy.]

Emilia: [That’s true. Garfiel’s a gentle person, so I’m worried about that…]

Garfiel: [——Hk! Who’s gentle!? What’re ya talkin’ bout, Emilia-sama!]

As expected of him, Garfiel hurriedly tried to deflect Emilia’s sarcastic words. Anastasia eyed him curiously, wondering why he seemed so embarrassed, when,

???: [Ah! Garf’s here! Miss, why didn’t you tell me!?]

The wooden door of the inn was flung open with a bang. The racket was caused by Mimi, a catgirl whose lovely face shone brightly as she noticed her audience. She flew into the room and surprised everyone by firmly grasping Garfiel’s arm.

Mimi: [Welcome! You’re tired, you’re tired, so Mimi will guide you to your room! That’s where you’ll be staying! Hey, you’re not budging at all!]

Garfiel: [Oi, oi, wait, wait! My amazin’ self hasn’t agreed… You’re strong! What!?]

Mimi: [This way! That way! Hurry!]

The petite Mimi clung to Garfiel’s arm and, though he should have been strong enough to break free, he was dragged along helplessly, nonetheless. Perhaps she was using a secret technique, but it was way more likely that Garfiel did not want to distance Mimi by shaking her off. After all, despite appearances, they were supposed to be the same age.

Anastasia: [Hmmm…]

Garfiel allowed himself to be dragged away with little resistance and Anastasia had a rare troubled look on her face, as did Emilia.

Anastasia: [Haaaaa, Mimi’s always been lively, but even so I can’t help but be surprised just now.]

Emilia: [Ah, that’s right. That’s good. I thought you might have felt she left you alone.]

Anastasia: [Not at all, that’s not a problem. However——]

After their exchange, Anastasia’s briefly softened gaze sharpened. Finding himself chilled to the bone by that calm look, Subaru unconsciously moved to stand in front of Emilia.

Anastasia: [I’d like you to tell me what kind of a child he is, the one who has attracted Mimi’s attention.]

The dangerous question was loaded with the quiet, burning rage a woman would hold towards pests who surrounded her cute daughter or little sister. It subtly conveyed that Mimi was loved, and, although they’d arrived early, the thought of dealing with this left Subaru exhausted.

???: […Why is it, Natsuki-san, that you suddenly have such a tired face?]

At that moment, Otto, who had returned from securing the ground dragons and their carriage, found Subaru in an exhausted state and joined their gathering at the entrance of the inn.

※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※　※

Pristella’s famed hotel, the Water Plumage Pavilion, was tiled with wooden floorboards resembling

tatami

mats. [1] This place was clearly geared toward exhausted pedestrians like Subaru, who immediately seated himself on a cushion.

Subaru: [If you’re that obsessed with me, I may get in over my head.]

Beatrice: [What are you babbling about all of a sudden, in fact. Why are you so restless, I suppose?]

Beatrice calmly took a seat next to him, in front of a table, but Emilia and others seemed puzzled at the notion of sitting directly on the floor. The long wooden desk and the large hall were all reminiscent of a Japanese-style inn, excluding the lack of an actual tatami floor.

However, a true expert like Subaru found some reasons to take away some points.

Subaru: [For example, this place lacks a sliding door and a paper door, and, unfortunately, the employees are not dressed in

kimonos

. [2] It’s in poor taste to resemble a

ryokan

[3] on the outside, but not faithfully reproducing the atmosphere.”

Ultimately, Subaru could not shake away the uncomfortable feeling that the setting was straight out of a fantasy in spite of the employees’ clothing and hospitality.

Subaru: [So, my grade totals to seventy points. This place is barely acceptable, but what’s good’s good, that’s how I would judge it. I hope you will work hard to improve in the future.]

Beatrice: [What are you talking about, in fact?]

Subaru: [It’s a cheap, spirited, and light-hearted kind of fun that relieves my frustration… so I’ll be fine even if you let go of my hand.]

Beatrice: […Just to be sure, I’ll hold it for a little while longer, I suppose.]

The grip on Subaru’s left hand slightly strengthened, and he said no more, instead turning to face Emilia on his right. Emilia, who had been examining the strange surroundings, noticed his gaze.

Emilia: [It’s so amazing, isn’t it? It’s only a little strange from the outside, but I feel reaaally odd as soon as I enter it, sitting on the floor and taking off my shoes…]

Subaru: [I didn’t have a bed in my bedroom, I had a futon on the floor. I’d be surprised if this place doesn’t have any… Would the employees let me have one?]

Otto: [What an unusual and unnecessary proposition… Or, rather, is Natsuki-san familiar with Kararagi-style customs?]

Otto, sitting opposite Beatrice, joined the conversation between Subaru and Emilia. The phrase “Kararagi-style” caught Subaru’s attention, causing him to frown.

Subaru: [‘Kararagi-style’? Is this building a product of it?]

Otto: [That’s right, these

wafuu

[4] architectural styles are designs taken from Kararagi, although their use isn’t as widespread here. In Kararagi itself, designs much akin to the Water Plumage Pavilion’s own are considered traditional.]

Subaru: [So why is this hotel in that style? Is it a diplomacy thing?]

This

wafuu

architecture was doubtlessly of Japanese design. Subaru wanted to confirm his suspicions on why that was.

And as if to supplement Subaru’s thoughts, Otto raised a finger and spoke.

Otto: [That would be because of Pristella’s history itself. Hoshin of the Wilderness was responsible for its construction. I trust you’ve heard of him?]

Subaru: [Really, I’ve heard a bit about this Hoshin of the Wilderness.]

Otto: [Despite being born in such a dark age, he managed so many achievements. Even calling him a Sage would not be a stretch. However, it was because of how dazzling he was that disputes ended up happening.]

Otto’s story took place just over a hundred years ago, when Pristella had been split between Lugunican and Kararagian cultures. Pristella was geographically Lugunican, but its founder Hoshin considered himself and was considered by the world as a native of Kararagi. Lugunica disliked the cultural influence of Kararagi and had tried to eradicate all traces of its culture, but the locals took offense and protested, which led to several territorial disputes between Lugunica and Kararagi. Eventually, diplomatic relations deteriorated to the point where both countries had been on the verge of cutting off their relationship.

Otto: [Fortunately, this didn’t last. Gradually, regulations became more relaxed, and Lugunica and Kararagi mended their relations. During that period, import of Kararagi’s customs slowed down. It was probably due to this ordeal that Lugunica felt secure in letting its security measures become more lax.]

Subaru: [In any case, it’s good the problem was solved. So Kararagi customs can be traced back to Hoshin?]

Otto: [It seems so. Hoshin was a person with innovative ideas from the start. His influences on ideology, technology, and legislation were immense.]

Subaru: [——I see.]

Subaru drew his hand to his chin. He had received the answer he was looking for.

Otto’s story confirmed that Kararagi’s founding father, Hoshin of the Wilderness, had the same identity as Subaru and Al, that of a person summoned from a different world.

Subaru now knew of three people who had been summoned into another world, but the timings were all off. Hoshin from four-hundred years ago, Al from twenty years ago, and himself from one year ago.

Subaru did not understand the time gap, or why he had been chosen, and it was meaningless for him to speculate wildly. But he certainly was not alone. Just knowing that granted Subaru’s heart some small salvation.

Anastasia: [——It would appear that everyone’s enjoying this

ryokan

.]

A thin sliding door made of wood slid open quietly, and Anastasia, entering with perfect timing, stood at the other side with a smile. And, standing next to her,

???: [Long time no see, Emilia-sama. I sincerely apologize for being late. I should have been the first to welcome you.]

A man with an apologetic face and a sweet, soft spoken voice. Just from hearing it, many women would assume it to be the voice of an angel. An amusing pipe dream, but the voice did have the necessary color, beauty, and strength. This was the voice of the Finest of Knights, Julius Juukulius, which existed solely to vex others’ hearts by simply existing. At least, that was how it felt to Subaru.

Emilia: [Mhm, it’s been a while, Julius. You look like you’re doing well.]

Julius: [I am grateful for your consideration. Likewise, Emilia-sama’s kindness and beauty are ever the more polished. It’s as if the shade of your gaze alone strengthens this Kingdom, while the rest of the world suffers a loss.]

Subaru found his speech, as always, pretentious and disgusting. Julius turned his gaze from Emilia to Subaru.

Julius: [It’s been a while since we’ve met face to face. You seem lively as always, Natsuki Subaru-dono.]

Subaru: […Stop with your phony attitude, it sends shivers down my spine. “Subaru-dono” my ass, you’re so transparent.]

Julius: [It’s a well-known fact that you were officially recognized as Emilia-sama’s Knight. Your former disrespect of the position should now be disregarded by both of us. First and foremost, as a Knight, are you trying to behave accordingly?]

Watching Julius’s virtuous attitude, Subaru scowled.

Subaru: [Yeah, I’m her Knight now. No one thought I could do it, but here I am.]

Julius: [I see. Although your position has changed, your attitude has not—— In that case, I will make do without the courtesy.]

Julius dropped his formal attitude and gave a slight smile before approaching and looking down towards Subaru, who was sitting on the floor.

Julius: [Then, once again… Long time no see, Natsuki Subaru. Have you been working hard every day to be an honorable Knight?]

Subaru: [Do you even need to ask? After all, I was beaten horribly by someone who thought I was dishonorable, or whatever.]

Julius: [It seems my reputation is being attacked. I recall it being an honorable duel.]

Subaru: [Don’t oversimplify it, you bastard…]

However, the one at fault had been Subaru, and even if he tried to say otherwise, it would only make himself look worse. So Subaru, rather than futilely defend himself, insulted Julius in a light exchange of banter. Seeing this, Julius narrowed his eyes as if to say “Hmm”.

Julius: [It seems that your shortcomings have been rectified somewhat. If you learn to see things with a Knight’s perspective, you will go far. Emilia-sama and Roswaal-sama have an eye for potential, it seems. Even so…]

Subaru: [————?]

After appraising Subaru, Julius looked around until his yellow eyes stopped on Beatrice, who met his gaze steadily with her own pale blue eyes.

Beatrice: [What is it? You shouldn’t stare too hard at a lady, I suppose.]

Julius: [That was terribly rude of me. I did not expect that a high-level Spirit like you would be present here.]

Beatrice: [Because Betty is Subaru’s

partner

, it is natural I appear here. I am on a completely different level than the Quasi Spirits who you have brought in. I wonder if you are afraid of me, in fact.]

Beatrice stood with her hands on Subaru’s shoulders and her chest puffed up. That grumpy attitude was based on Julius’s attitude toward Subaru, who was inferior to Julius in every way except one. Both were Spirit Knights, but Subaru’s contracted Spirit was of a higher grade.

Julius was accompanied by his six Quasi Spirits, one for each of the six attributes. Great Spirits were stronger than Quasi Spirits, who in turn were stronger than Micro Spirits. Taking that into consideration, it could be said that Subaru and Beatrice were the stronger team.

——However.

Subaru: [If you’re comparing actual ability, we have so many faults and are such a waste of potential that we can’t even compare to his Quasi Spirits.]

Beatrice: [Hmph. If he does not stop disrespecting Subaru… I’ll tell you what will happen if you disdain Betty’s

partner

, even if you are a handsome man who causes Betty’s heart to waver, I suppose!]

Subaru: [A handsome man who causes your heart to waver!?]

That was hardly what Subaru had wanted to hear, but it was Julius himself, a possible cause of the crack in their relationship, who explained the reason.

Julius: [Do not misunderstand, your Spirit is not going to betray you. Her instinct is merely being shaken by my Divine Protection.]

Subaru: [Your protection…? Seriously, you also have one? What kind of protection?]

Julius: [The protection I have is the Divine Protection of Gathering Spirits. Simply speaking, it is a kind of Divine Protection that garners the favor of Spirits. I also have a contract with Quasi Spirits of six attributes. Only with the power of that protection am I able to maintain them.]

Beatrice: [Betty will not lose! Subaru is better than you… I suppose!]

Subaru: [Thank you! Please, don’t hurt me any further!]

Although the bond of trust between Subaru and Beatrice was unbreakable, he was still disappointed at her lack of a firm response. Whenever Subaru faced Julius he would, without fail, become worked up over any of his own shortcomings. That had been the main reason for his former hatred of Julius.

Anastasia: [As usual, our Knight’s payin’ attention to Natsuki-kun.]

Julius: [Not at all. I am merely discussing the attitude of a Knight as his senior. One’s view of the Knights of the Kingdom of Lugunica may be appraised from his behavior.]

Anastasia: [Well, Natsuki-kun already has a reputation as a Knight, doesn’t he? You’re really dishonest, Julius.]

In response to Anastasia’s teasing, Julius lowered his head and nodded silently. Anastasia probably would have won anyway, only to be smug about it later. Their motions had that air of familiarity.

——Beatrice patted Subaru’s left shoulder, while Emilia his right.

Beatrice: [Don’t be too worried, in fact. Looks aren’t everything, I suppose.]

Emilia: [I’m glad that Subaru and Julius are getting along, I’d be happy if you two became good friends.]

Subaru: [Thank you for this mood where it’s hard to say thank you…]

How would other people view this? All Subaru could receive from them was unhelpful comfort. He scratched his cheek with frustration as Anastasia took a seat across from him.

Subaru: [Come to think of it, why are only the two of you here? Mimi and Garfiel… are probably on a date, but…]

Anastasia: [It’s like you said, Mimi’s with the blonde child right now. Hetaro adores his sister and is probably keeping an eye on them, and Tivey is probably keeping an eye on Hetaro. That’s why they’re not with me at the moment.]

Subaru: [Did Ricardo not come? I know that the kitten triplets are pretty strong, but isn’t it comforting to have a full-grown Knight around?]

It was odd that the triplets were here, but Ricardo, that large Kobold that betrayed one’s expectations for his race and who usually handled their antics, was missing, as was Julius’s brother Joshua.

Julius: [Unfortunately, we’re not in Pristella just for fun. Ricardo and my brother Joshua have business elsewhere. You should have met him by now, yes?]

Subaru: [Yeah… and he’s a lot like you. If his frame were a little steadier, he could play you perfectly. Actually, he should do that anyway. You can leave now.]

Julius: [I’ll keep your interesting opinion in mind, but that would be difficult for Joshua. He is not a child well suited for excessive travel. Frustratingly, I hold several concerns about him, as his older brother.]

To Subaru’s annoyance, Julius took him seriously and began worrying about Joshua. Otto interrupted Subaru’s awkward silence by clearing his throat.

Otto: [Hmmm—— I don’t mind this casual atmosphere, but now that almost everyone’s here, could we all give introductions?]

Anastasia: [I’d like introductions too, since the only people here I really know’re Emilia-san and Natsuki-kun. I especially wanna hear more about this competent-lookin’ officer and that powerful Great Spirit-chan.]

Subaru: [Oioi, it’s really not like you to be lacking information, Anastasia-san. Is something amiss in your reports?]

Otto: [I can imagine why you would have that impression, but I think it would be best if we don’t get into whose information is accurate!]

Subaru stuck out his tongue and tried to look cute, as the so-called “competent-looking” Internal Affairs Minister held his head in his hands, making noise.

Dodging a question by the competent seeming officer, she gave a nod to Julius.

Julius: [Allow me to reintroduce myself. I am Julius Juukulius of the Royal Guards of the Kingdom of Lugunica, although presently I am merely serving as Anastasia-sama’s Knight.]

Julius gave Otto a slight bow, who nodded in response to his elegant gesture. Julius then moved on to an introduction of his master, Anastasia.

Julius: [You are in the presence of one the candidates for Monarch of the Kingdom of Lugunica, Anastasia Hoshin, the gifted businesswoman who runs Kararagi’s Hoshin Trading Company.]

Otto: [Right… Right, yes!]

Subaru: [Don’t bow to just an introduction!]

Otto: [——Hk! It was a mistake, the momentum was overwhelming!]

Subaru gave the back of Otto’s head a whack, as Anastasia watched, pleased with Julius’s introduction.

Subaru: [Don’t be intimidated by titles! Our Emilia-tan is a wonderful candidate for the same throne, and she won’t lose to Anastasia!]

Emilia: [Mh, that’s right. I’m also a candidate, so I’ll do my best.]

Subaru: [Ahhhh, you’re so cute. I can’t help but say EMT for the first time in a while!]

Emilia: [I’m somewhat troubled that I find your antics calming…]

Seeing their typical pointless banter, Otto regained his composure and faced the opposing camp.

Otto: [Thank you for your detailed introduction. I’m slightly late in saying this, but I am Otto Suwen, Emilia-sama’s Minister of Internal Affairs… Yes, thanks to certain circumstances caused by a certain someone, a Minister of Internal Affairs is indeed what I am.]

Subaru: [There seems to be bitterness about that decision.]

Otto: [Originally I was going to be a simple merchant, but now what has become of me…]

Although his voice echoed with lament, Subaru stood firm, refusing to give Otto the opportunity to escape. Anastasia stuck her tongue out in a show of sympathy for Otto.

Next, everyone turned to Beatrice. Seeing their gazes, she presented her small frame proudly and squarely, then declared,

Beatrice: [Betty is the Great Spirit Beatrice, I suppose. I am Subaru’s Contracted Spirit, I suppose. As you can see, Betty ranks highly both as a Spirit and in cuteness, in fact. I would appreciate some delicious tea and a sweet snack, I suppose.]

Subaru: [Maintain dignity until the end!]

It would always be in Beatrice’s nature to be a mascot character.

Subaru pulled her into his lap and began stroking her hair while she glared, displeased.

Subaru: [Well, that’s why she’s a Spirit in a Contract with me. It’s funny that both of us have the same part as the butt of all jokes, but…]

Julius: [I did believe you had a good compatibility with Spirits, so I would not call this unexpected, but I did not imagine a contract with a Great Spirit like Beatrice-sama would resemble this.]

Subaru: [Don’t praise my Beako too much. She’s just like her family, anything nice will just go to her head.]

Beatrice: [Hmph. I’m declaring my displeasure with that rough treatment, in fact.]

Beatrice gave him a look suggesting that she had barely accepted him, and Subaru tapped her cheeks in response. Now that things had calmed down,

Otto: [Well, introductions are over, and the atmosphere seems to have calmed down for time being. So, let’s talk business, yes?]

As Emilia’s Minister of Internal Affairs, it was Otto’s role to take the lead in conversations like this and prevent them from being derailed. Anastasia answered while fiddling with her white fox fur scarf.

Anastasia: [Eh…? Well, it’s our job as the hosts to entertain our guests. Feel free to do whatever you’d like.]

Otto: “Well then. First of all, what are your reasons for inviting us to Pristella?

Anastasia: [Don’t worry, ya don’t need to be so guarded. I’m not plannin’ anythin’. A year’s passed since the Royal Selection started, and we haven’t had opportunities to see each other as of late, so I thought I’d just set one up.]

Most people would be easily misled by her gentle demeanor, but Otto was a veteran at negotiating. The conversation had turned into a battle between merchants.

Otto: [Taking our situation into consideration, we are present here because you lured us with bait. It is only natural that we would be cautious.]

Anastasia: [Well, we did invite you here for a reason. There are souvenirs in Pristella that ya’d want, right? Think of it as a gift.]

Subaru: […How did you know which gift we would want?]

Anastasia: [It’s sorta a company secret, Natsuki-kun. We’ll just say that I’m an inquisitive gal and leave it at that.]

Anastasia covered her mouth while laughing. It would be a stretch to say she was making fun of Subaru’s frustration, but that was how it felt to him. Aware of his angst, Beatrice could not help but sigh, while Subaru wondered how Anastasia learned of their circumstances.

Emilia: [It’s not something I was hiding, so it was inevitable for that information to leak.]

Emilia’s frank admission assuaged a part of Subaru’s worries, and Anastasia blinked in Emilia’s direction, who responded by tilting her head.

Emilia: [From this point onwards, I think that it would be better if everyone appreciated what Anastasia’s done, instead of being suspicious of her.]

Anastasia: […Respondin’ to your enemy in such a well-intentioned way. Besides, I’m not helpin’ ya purely for your benefit, Emilia-san.]

Emilia: [But thanks to you I have a way to find what I’ve been looking for. Thank you. I don’t know how I can repay you, but I truly do thank you.]

Anastasia: [————]

Anastasia’s eyes widened at Emilia’s smiling response. To her surprise, Julius, seated next to her, softened his gaze, earning himself a glare.

Anastasia: [Is something strange, Julius?]

Julius: [No, it is merely that your surprised expression is so rare. I think that it is just as beautiful as your natural, unaffected face.]

Anastasia: [Trying to escape with flattery… Well, I still appreciate those sweet words.]

With the help of Julius’s words, Anastasia shook off her surprise and regained her usual tone. Then she fixed a sharpened gaze on a curious Emilia.

Anastasia: [Emilia-san, it’s been a year and you still have a disadvantage that ya need to work around.]

Emilia: [Mhm, I’m lacking in many areas and causing everyone so much trouble, so I’m trying hard to catch up as soon as I…]

Anastasia: [One correction. Your greatest disadvantage ain’t that. It’s that ya resemble the terrifying Witch from those stories.]

Anastasia exhaled deeply and smiled, causing Emilia to stiffen in shock at her sudden change in attitude. Disregarding her, Anastasia turned to Subaru and Otto.

Anastasia: [What about you two? Will you continue to support her? If you do, her reputation will affect your own.]

Subaru: [I will, and I’ll do my best to, because it’s my policy to praise and support her no matter what!]

Otto: [Because of that, most of the burden lands on me. Funnily enough, I have no way out either…]

Subaru throwing a thumbs-up, Otto glaring with a bitter gaze. Seeing their conflicting attitudes, Anastasia readjusted her scarf.

Anastasia: [Well, it’s fine. You surely understand the value of gratitude, after all.]

Otto: [Gratitude, huh? Gratitude is great. You don’t have to keep it in the inventory, and there’s no deadline attached to it.]

Anastasia: [Yep, isn’t that right? And most importantly——]

Otto’s words matched Anastasia’s as the two each revealed the face of a merchant.

Anastasia and Otto: [——You don’t have to put a price tag on it.]

They spoke unanimously.

Anastasia clapped her hands as Otto drooped his shoulders. It seemed that it was an established saying. Their perspectives on gratitude were chillingly identical.

Anastasia: [Now, back to what Emilia-san needs… Colorless magical ore, one of the highest possible grade of purity.]

Emilia: [Yes, that’s right. Can you tell me what you know?]

On the way to Pristella, Emilia, having consciously realized that she had been acting out of selfishness, had felt guilty and had not intended to involve Subaru and Otto and the others. Nevertheless, with the opportunity right in front of her, she of course needed to act. She was closer than ever to seeing her precious family again.

As Emilia held her breath for a while, Anastasia replied.

Anastasia: [The best supplier of high-density ore is the Muse Company. The person responsible for it currently resides in this town, Kiritaka Muse—— A man whose heart was stolen by a Songstress.]

Translation Notes:

This chapter features quite a few Japanese terms which have been left in romanized Japanese since they refer to specific objects from Japanese tradition.

[1] – Tatami are traditional Japanese floor mats used for sitting on or as the flooring in dojos. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami

[2] – Kimono are a type of traditional Japanese dress. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono

[3] – Ryokan are a form of traditional Japanese inns which commonly feature communal baths. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan

[4] – Wafuu translates to “Japanese-styled”. This term comes from Kararagi like the other in-universe Japanese terms; it seems to instead mean “Kararagi-styled” here.
